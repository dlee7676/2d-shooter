This is a demonstration level of a vertical-scrolling shooter engine made with DirectX. The concept is based on "danmaku", or "bullet curtain" games such as the Touhou Project series. Notable features are pointed out in annotations.

Aside from the green particles, the assets used (player, enemy, and bullet sprites, and background images) are not mine, and are only used to demonstrate the program.
